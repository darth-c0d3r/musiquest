- normalize the schema [remove redundancy in num_views etc.] ?

- user_song views (multiple) and song num_views (once) are updated differently even for the same user.

*Clarifications:

	- The user_playlist relation is essentially unique for each playlist, stores the user who created the playlist (and hence can make updates). Hence should contain all playlist related data.
	- The song_playlist is a relation denoting which song belongs to which playlist. 

*Functionality Specifications:

	- Artist page will only display metadata, and list of ALL albums (infinite scroll view)
	- New songs can be added to playlist only through 'Add to playlist' option in song

	- Difference between temporary and permanent playlist?? None in terms of back-end

	- Remember to check uniqueness of playlist names for a user when creating new playlist

	- 0=DEFAULT 1=MYQUEUE 2=SUGGESTED

	- only default playlist should be deletable

	- What to do for songs with no album name?

*Future Scope:
	
	- Autoplay songs	 


	delete from song_playlist where playlist_id = 1 and exists (select * from user_playlist where user_id = 1 and playlist_id = 1 and playlist_type = 0
